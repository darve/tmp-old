<h2 class="title">About us</h2>
<p>You can’t get around how incredibly important and yet difficult it can be moving home. Even if you’ve never done it, you’ve heard how stressful it can be. We understand this at TMP, which is why we aim to make that journey an enjoyable one. Mortgages are a huge commitment, but they don’t need to be scary. So let TMP take the hassle away and let’s do it with a smile. We love what we do and you will too. Because mortgages don’t have to be dull. We’ll help you with the black and white stuff so you can concentrate on bringing some colour into your world.</p>
<p>Your home may be repossessed if you do not keep up repayments on your mortgage.</p>
<p>There will be a fee for mortgage advice. The actual amount you pay will depend upon your circumstances.  The fee is up to 1%, but a typical fee is 0.3% of the amount borrowed.</p>
