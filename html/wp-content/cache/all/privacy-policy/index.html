<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes stated above, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and it is compatible with the original purpose. Please contact us or an explanation as to how any new processing compatible with the original purpose.<br />
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

<h3>Marketing communications</h3>
<p>Your personal information collected as part of an application for a Housing Association / Registered Provider property will not be used for the purposes of marketing communications.<br />
